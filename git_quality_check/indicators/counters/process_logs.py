def process_logs(logs: list[str], functions: list[str:int]):
    """
    Call a list of functions on the commit logs.
    Each function is a scoring function that returns either 1 or 0.
    The method then returns the percent of functions having returned 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    logs: list[str]
        The commit logs.
    functions: list[str:int]
        A list of scoring functions, taking a commit log as a parameter
        and returning either 1 or 0.
        Note, it is expected that all scoring functions have the same `meaning`.
        That is, they all return 1 (or 0) when the logs is validated (or unvalidated).

    Returns
     -------
    percent: float
        The percent of functions having returned 1.
